Next steps:
- Fix "rename" to correctly handle renamed directories:
  - While frozen_files has a subpath of renamed directory, sleep without holding any lock.
  - Once it doesn't, become a reader, and get the pending_commits lock.
  - Go through pending_commits and pending_luc and rewrite anything that's a subpath of the renamed directory.
  - Perform the rename while holding the pending_commits lock.
- Rewrite lock library to use POSIX locks, not spinlocks.

Also change shell script on Baelfire to kill everything when lower level is disconnected through FUSE.

Locking protocol:
- Doing pretty much anything at all requires holding onto
  frozen_files_lock as a reader, else someone could add the file
  you're working on to frozen_files while you're doing stuff with it.
- If you need to make sure the commits thread is not copying or
  mkdiring, hold active_commits_lock.
- Locking order:
  - frozen_files_lock (writer)
  - active_commits_lock
  - pending_commits_lock
